# Jupyter tutorial

This is largely a training bed for myself to ramp up on Python data science and
machine-learning techniques and technologies. 

For the moment, this is entirely inward facing, so I have not provided extensive
documentation of the notebooks. They are intended to be self-documenting.

If you do happen through, feel free to leave comments or open issues / PRs.

## Installation

With python3 installed locally, clone this repository and run:

```bash
$ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install -r requirements-freeze.txt
```

Use `jupyter notebook` to run the notebook
